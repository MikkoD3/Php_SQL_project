# Php_SQL_project
This is my Project for PHP/SQL course at laurea. Goal was to create simple php image gallery.

#Installation

1. Install xampp

2. Copy the php_SQL_project folder to xampp/htdocs

3. Start xampp, and then start apache and sql

4. Go to phpMyAdmin and create a database "php_database"

5. Import the createtables.sql file from sql directory.

6. Now the databse is set, next check what port is xampp using: Apache -> config -> Apache(httpd.conf)

7. Now to start using the app go to 127.0.0.1:*your port number*/*foldername*/index.php
  Note: foldername is the folder which you place in xampp/htdocs

8. Start using the App!
